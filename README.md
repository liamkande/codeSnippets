# Code Snippets Manager

ðŸš€ **A modern code snippets management application built with Next.js 15**

Code Snippets Manager is a full-stack web application that allows developers to create, store, edit, and organize their code snippets. The app features a dual-environment architecture: using a SQLite database with Prisma in development and React Context for state management in production (for demo purposes).

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 18.x
- npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd snippets
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up the database** (for development):
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   npx prisma db push
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   ```

5. **Open the application**:
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Environment Architecture

### Development Environment
- **Database**: SQLite with Prisma ORM
- **Data Operations**: Server Actions and API routes
- **Benefits**: Persistent data storage, real database operations, full CRUD with validation

### Production Environment
- **State Management**: React Context
- **Data Operations**: In-memory state management
- **Benefits**: Demo-friendly, no database setup required, instant deployment

The application automatically detects the environment using `process.env.NODE_ENV` and switches between the two modes seamlessly.

## Available Scripts

- **Start development server**:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- **Build for production**:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

- **Start production server**:
  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```

- **Lint code**:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

- **Generate Prisma client**:
  ```bash
  npx prisma generate
  ```

- **Push database schema**:
  ```bash
  npx prisma db push
  ```

---

## Database Schema

The application uses a simple schema for storing code snippets:

```prisma
model Snippet {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  title String
  code  String
}
```

### Database Operations (Development)
- **Create**: Add new snippets to SQLite database
- **Read**: Fetch snippets with Prisma queries
- **Update**: Modify existing snippets
- **Delete**: Remove snippets from database

---

## Context State Management (Production)

The production environment uses React Context for demo purposes:

```typescript
interface SnippetContextType {
  snippets: Snippet[]
  addSnippet: (title: string, code: string) => void
  deleteSnippet: (id: number) => void
  updateSnippet: (id: number, title: string, code: string) => void
}
```

### Context Operations (Production)
- **Create**: Add snippets to in-memory state
- **Read**: Access snippets from context
- **Update**: Modify snippets in state
- **Delete**: Remove snippets from state

---

## Key Components

### Monaco Editor Integration
- Full-featured code editor with syntax highlighting
- VS Code-like editing experience
- Configurable themes and language support
- Real-time code editing with change detection

### Responsive Design
